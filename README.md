### A(*)Star Pathfinding

This was created to demonstrate the A-Star Pathfinding algorithm<br>

### Code

The program was created entirely in Python3<br>
I have included comments in the code that will help the user understand how the algorithm works<br>
This was intended as a personal project and I have taken help from resources on the web.<br>
Implemented pygame for visualization

### Controls

You can set the maze any way you like where '0' denote movable blocks and '1' denote restricted blocks<br>
Set the starting node as start = (x,y) as the co-ordinates and end = (x1,y1) as the co-ordinates where x,y,x1,y1 are variable<br>
Path is returned in form of an array of tuples.
